		<h1>Artists on Twitter Finder<br>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<p><a href="./">Back to search engine</a></p>
	</header>

	<main class="text-align-left">
		<h2>Why is it necessary to enter a link to a webpage, and not to an image ?</h2>

		<p>Because it is necessary to find the artist's Twitter account(s). Indeed :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is not possible to index all images posted on Twitter. Plus, it would build a 99% useless database.</li>
			<li>And it's impossible to distinguish artists' Tweets to Tweets from people who repost their illustrations.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Thus, we must analyze the source of the illustration to find the Twitter account(s) of the artist of the illustration.</p>
		<p>This analysis is therefore different for each source website. So different algorithms are needed for each website. This is why there is a restricted list of supported websites.</p>

		<h2>I have an illustration, but no link (No source). What can I do ?</h2>

		<p>As explained above, Artist on Twitter Finder cannot perform a search directly with an image file.</p>
		<p>Here is a list of image search engines that might help you find where an artist has published an illutration :</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://saucenao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SauceNAO</a>, specialized in artists' illustrations. It is thus very precise in its results.</li>
			<li><a href="https://tineye.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TinEye</a>, generalist, but tries to highlight the source websites of the images.</li>
			<li><a href="https://yandex.com/images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yandex</a>, generalist, also works with modified or cropped images.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.google.fr/imghp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Images</a>, same comments as for Yandex.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Why can illustrations take a long time to be processed ?</h2>

		<p>There are two main limitations&nbsp;:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The rate limits on Twitter's APIs. And they are very drastic.</li>
			<li>Image analysis time.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Thus, if it is necessary to index or update the indexing of a Twitter account, the processing time of the illustrations will be very long. And this time increases with the number of illustrations being processed in the server.</p>

		<h2>How are artists' Twitter accounts searched ?</h2>

		<p>The search for Twitter accounts consists in analyzing web pages looking for links (URL). The AOTF server looks for links on the illustration's webpage, as well as on the artist's profile. If a link leads to a Twitter account, it will be considered as belonging to the artist. Moreover, if a link leads to a profile on another supported site, it will also be considered as belonging to the artist, and the search for Twitter accounts will be recursive.</p>
		<p>If multiple Twitter accounts are found, they will all be considered as the artist's.</p>

		<p>Details on Twitter accounts search for each supported website :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>DeviantArt&nbsp;: In the description of the illustration and in the artist's biography on his/her profile.</li>
			<li>Pixiv&nbsp;: In the links indicated by the artist on his profile.</li>
			<li>Boorus (Danbooru, Derpibooru, Furbooru)&nbsp;: In the informations about the artist, as well as the source of the illustration, if it comes from a supported website. Warning&nbsp;: If the source is a Tweet, the associated Twitter account is not considered as the artist's Twitter account (Except for sources on Danbooru).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Notes :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The search for Twitter accounts is done independently for each illustration. No association is stored.</li>
			<li>If the Twitter accounts found are non-existent or deleted, suspended, deactivated, or private, they will be considered as invalids, because no indexing or search can be made. In addition, AOTF has a blacklist of accounts that are listed for containing a lot of Tweets with media, without being artist accounts. If an account found is on this list, it will also be considered as invalid.</li>
			<li>If a link leads to a profile on one of the following websites, this profile will also be scanned for Twitter accounts&nbsp;: Linktree, Patreon and Carrd.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>I am an artist, I have a Twitter account, but it is not found. Why ?</h2>

		<p>Make sure you've put <b>a link</b> to your Twitter account where the server is searching (See above).</p>

		<h2>What data is stored ?</h2>

		<p>The following data is stored in the database :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Twitter accounts&nbsp;: ID of the Twitter account, and index cursors for this account.</li>
			<li>Tweets&nbsp;: ID of the Tweet, ID of the associated Twitter account, IDs and fingerprints of associated images.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Notes&nbsp;:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is impossible to "rebuild" images from fingerprints.</li>
			<li>Tweets without an image are not indexed.</li>
		</ul>
